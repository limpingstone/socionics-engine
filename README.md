# socionics-engine
A program that identifies the personalities of a person based on the socionics model. 
Powered by Python 3.6, initial release on 01/01/2019

The model inputs functions from the Jungian cognitive functions, respectively the dominant functions and the auxiliary functions and outputs the personality type according to the socionics model. The input should contain all 8 Jungian cognitive functions in different orders, yet the list can be generated by just having the first two functions. 

To test the functionality of the engine, modify the code in run_test.py and type in the following command: 
```
$ python3 run_test.py
```
